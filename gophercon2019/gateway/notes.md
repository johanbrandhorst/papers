## Technical requirements

I will require access to a clip-on microphone as the first part of my talk will
be a matter of slides and I like to walk around the stage a little while
presenting.

## Expert knowledge

I think I'm qualified to give a talk on this topic as I am one of the
maintainers of the gRPC-Gateway project. I have delivered
[a shorter version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLJEgbTKaU) of this talk to
the Go London User Group, which was well received.

I have given more talks on gRPC related topics, please see my
[presentations page](https://jbrandhorst.com/page/presentations/) for more.

I run [a personal blog](https://jbrandhorst.com) talking mostly about Go and
gRPC, please check it out for more background.

I'm frequently helping pepople in the #grpc channel on the Gophers slack through
my own deep experience with writing Go gRPC services, both for work and as hobby
projects.

See [my github](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) for a summary of some of the
projects I've created and contributed to.
