## Introduction

The de-facto standard of microservice communications today is JSON/REST,
but many companies and open source projects are adopting gRPC for greenfield
projects as well as existing architectures. It offers type safe,
high performance RPC for polyglot environments, but does not on its own
integrate well into existing JSON/REST architectures.
