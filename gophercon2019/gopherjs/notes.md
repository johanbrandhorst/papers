## Technical requirements

I will require access to a clip-on microphone as the first part of my talk will
be a matter of slides and I like to walk around the stage a little while
presenting.

## Expert knowledge

I think I'm qualified to give a talk on this topic as I am the author of the
GopherJS gRPC-Web bindings. I am also a maintainer of the Improbable gRPC-Web
client and proxy implementation. I have delivered
[a shorter version](<https://video.fosdem.org/2018/H.1308%20(Rolin)/gopherjs.webm>)
of this talk to the Go room at FOSDEM 2018, which was well received. I have also
given it at the Go meetups in London, Cambridge and Budapest.

I have given more talks on gRPC related topics, please see my
[presentations page](https://jbrandhorst.com/page/presentations/) for more.

I run [a personal blog](https://jbrandhorst.com) talking mostly about Go and
gRPC, please check it out for more background.

I'm frequently helping pepople in the #grpc channel on the Gophers slack through
my own deep experience with writing Go gRPC services, both for work and as hobby
projects.

See [my github](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) for a summary of some of the
projects I've created and contributed to.
