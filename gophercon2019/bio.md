I’m Johan, I like gaming, programming, floorball, skiing and many other things.
I’m originally from Sweden but I live and work in the United Kingdom.
I work at InfoSum, a data collaboration startup in Basingstoke, UK.

I have contributed to the Go programming language, and I run my own blog,
mostly talking about Go and gRPC.

You can find me on the Gophers Slack under the id jbrandhorst, where I like to
hang around and discuss Go with fellow Gophers.
